i will give you a sample of how CFD is calculated let us take for example two days and four columns backlog, todo, wip, done, on Day1 10am backlog=5, todo=0, wip=0, done=0 again on day1 12pm backlog=3 (no change but movement from backlog to todo), todo=2, wip=0, done=0, day1 3pm, backlog=3 (no change and no movement from backlog), todo 1 (movement to wip), wip=1, done=0 so total items on day1 is 5, and on day2 we add +3 to backlog to previous 3 in backlog at 10am day2, backlog=6, todo=1, wip=0, done=1, day2 1pm, backlog=5 (no change and movement from backlog to todo), todo=1 (and move 1 to wip), wip=1, done=1, day2 4pm backlog=4(movement to todo), todo=2, wip=0 (move wip to done1) and done=2 so total items on day2 is 8
